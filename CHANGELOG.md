# Changelog

### [0.1.2] - 2025-08-17
- Tuned parameters for **safer, more accurate indexing** of encrypted fields.
- Updated documentation and **open-sourced the code** (repo now public).

### [0.1.1] - 2025-08-10
- Optimized **chunk sizes** to **1 MiB** for all major file operations including **upload**, **copy** and **read**, which reduces the number of syscalls and improves throughput for large files.  
- Refined **shard size** selection algorithm â€” now uses a more granular scale from **1 KB** up to **512 MB**, ensuring better balance between the number of shards and their size for different file sizes.
- Improved initial **data validation** for forms on the frontend.

### [0.1.0] - 2025-08-03
- Added default **frontend** built with **React** and **Bootstrap**, including registration, authorization, login, profile editing, password change, and management of users, collections, and documents.

### [0.0.21] - 2025-07-27
- Improved annotation for **Public API**.

### [0.0.20] - 2025-07-20
- Removed full links to **userpics** and **thumbnails**. Instead, only the filenames are returned.

### [0.0.19] - 2025-07-13
- Refactored **LRU** to support caching of files stored in sharded form, allowing explicit insertion of decrypted data and retrieval by **key** rather than file paths.

### [0.0.18] - 2025-07-06
- Added **split** and **merge** methods for handling binary file sharding and reconstruction.
- Introduced logic to determine optimal shard size for splitting files into up to 5 parts.
- Added mechanism to randomly **shuffle shards**. This masks their original creation order by maximizing timestamp noise.
- Added splitting of encrypted data into random shards and their mixing during upload.

- Added a configuration setting to set the **intensity of shard mixing**.

### [0.0.17] - 2025-06-29
